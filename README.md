# Quantum Physics Game

A physics-based game where quantum effects manifest in macroscopic behavior, using the Standard Model of particle physics as the main mechanic.

## Core Mechanics

### Particle Interactions
Players manipulate fundamental particles and force carriers (gluons, photons, W and Z bosons, and gravitons) to create emergent behaviors.

### Energy Exchange
Use force carriers to transfer energy between particles, influencing larger structures.

### Quantum Superposition
Particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, affecting gameplay.

## Gameplay Elements

### Levels
Start at subatomic scale, progress to atomic, molecular, and macroscopic levels.

### Objectives
Solve puzzles or create specific macroscopic effects by manipulating quantum particles.

### Visual Style
Abstract representation of particles and forces, with vibrant colors and dynamic animations.

## Visualizations of Quantum Particle Behavior

The game will feature visualizations representing key quantum phenomena that are central to the game mechanics:

1. General quantum particle behavior, forming the foundation of the game's physics engine.
2. Quantum entanglement, a crucial concept for puzzle-solving and particle interactions across distances.
3. Quantum tunneling, which allows particles to pass through barriers, creating unexpected gameplay possibilities.

These visualizations will help players understand and interact with the quantum mechanics underlying the game's core systems.
